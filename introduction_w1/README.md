# Introduction to Machine Learning

This folder holds my personnal notes and python scripts related to the introduction course to Machine Learning from [Coursera's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#syllabus) course.

The sum up of key points from this course can be found in the `notes.md` file contained in this folder.

## Requirements

- python3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Scripts

- `model_representation.py` is simply a local implementation of the course's first labo, to get in touch with numpy and matplotlib.

- `gradient_descent.py` is my personnal implementation of the gradient algorithm implemented to minimize the cost function used to predict the price of a house depending on its surface.
